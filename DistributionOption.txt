Usage: udistrib -t<top dir> -r<repository>  -o<offset dir>
                -p<platforms|!platforms|@custom_view_file>
               [-q <ALL|OFFSETS|SETS|VERSIONS>] [-v <[@]version>] [-N <0|1>]
               [-G <string for globally accessible baseline> -v <@version>]
               [-L <1|(unx|wnt format dir)[,(unx|wnt format dir) -v <@version>]
               [-S <1|(unx|wnt format dir)[,(unx|wnt format dir) -v <@version>]
               [-T <number of segments> -F <segment size>]
               [-m <ALL|MINIMAL|MINIMUM>]
               [-l <Site ID>]
               [-j <Command to Run>]
                -a -A -b -c -C -d -e -f -M -O -Q -s -u -x -z

-a: Platform amnesia - don't remember previously synchronized platforms
-A: Autoindex reference structure when unpacking
-b: Batch mode
-B: Autoindex Baselined Named reference structure when unpacking
-c: Set Directory Mode to 777
-C: Turn off the character count and diskspace checking
-d: Dry Run
-e: Disk space and character count errors treated as errors, not warnings.
    The application will terminate and no download will be performed.
    The default behavior is to display the errors, but to continue the download
-f: Force re-sync and re-unpack any zips.
-F: Sets the minimum segment size for multi-threaded Web downloads (Windows only)
-G: Register a globally accessible baseline instance
    Only a single global instance can be registered
-h: Print out this help message
-k: Keep - Don't delete the zip file after unpacking
-I: Sets PREV_ROOT to point to a local reference unit, if one
    is registered.  Adopt orphan unit with local parent baseline instance
-j: Run post udistrib command provided
-L: Register baseline instance that can be locally accessed from current host.
    Multiple instances are allowed to be registered locally.
    If you use -L 1, the value from the -t switch will be used.
-l: Select the site for DMS .latest Baseline Instance Queries
    If you use -l <site_id>, it will use the given site to pull from
    If you use -l chain, it will run a daisy chain of sites
-m: Keep Zips (ALL|MINIMAL|MINIMUM)
    ALL:     Keep ALL Zips
    MINIMAL: Keep ALL Zips Up To Latest Rebase Checkpoint
    MINIMUM: Keep Only Zips needed to unpack sets
-M: Set umask (UNIX Only)
-N: Specify whether or not src is included in a baseline instance
    (0 - included, 1 - not included).  If this switch is not used, the default
    is the srcIncluded control parameter from the Environment Node Definition
-o: The offset directory under the distributions structure being
    pulled from in which to find the zip files.  This is generally
    a descriptive string that defines the basis of the distribution.
    If you are unsure what savesets are available, you can use the command:
    udistrib -r <repository location> -q OFFSETS
-O: Sets PREV_ROOT to point to a site (network based) reference unit, if one
    is registered.  Adopt orphan unit with site parent baseline instance
-p: Specify the platforms to synchronize or a Custom View File
    If you precede the 'platform' with a !, that entry will NOT be downloaded.
-q: Query repository information (ALL|OFFSETS|SETS|VERSIONS|REPOSITORY_ID)
-Q: Turn off output messages.  You are on you own.  Use with caution
-r: The distribution repository you wish to push or pull data from
-s: Synchronize/copy the specified zip file save sets
-S: Register a baseline instance that can be accessed by all hosts at a site.
    Only a single unix and a single windows site can be registered
    You can register both unix & windows location at same time via the format:
         -S format1,format2
    Where format1 can be 1 (gives you the value from the -t switch) or either
    the unix or windows format to the site visible directory
    format2 is the opposite (windows or unix) format to the site visible
    directory.  / and \ are important as they designate the different
    platform types
-t: The top directory for reference structure you are populating.
-T: Sets the number of segments for multi-threaded Web downloads (Windows only)
-u: Unpack save sets and create the reference structure
-W: Run UDULocator Synchronously
-v: Specify a specific version to synchronize
    When using DMS, this value will
    be the DMS_CURRENT_BASELINE value for the environment where the zip files
    were created.
-x: Sync/Populate plats in the order listed in the -p parameter.
-z: Transient mode.
-Z: Path to override the Log Location.
